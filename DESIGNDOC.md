## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document exists to record progress made on my project for Arch. It should be viewed by those looking for insight into why I made certain decisions or how I did certain things.

### 1.2 Scope

The project itself will be a linear regression model for stock market prediction, specifically Google's stock prices, based off of a data set containing Google stock prices from 2004 to today.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

List and define any terms, acronyms, or abbreviations used in this document.

### 1.4 References

List any documents or sources referenced in this design.

Brief description of what the rest of the document contains.

## 2. System Overview

High-level description of the system architecture, components, and interactions.

## 3. Design Considerations

### 3.1 Assumptions and Dependencies

List any assumptions and external dependencies (hardware, third-party libraries, etc.).

### 3.2 Constraints

Identify design constraints (e.g., language, platform, performance, security).

### 3.3 Goals and Guidelines

Define specific goals or design guidelines (e.g., maintainability, scalability).

## 4. Architecture Design

ER diagrams, schemas, or data flow between components.

### 6.2 Data Storage

Description of how and where data will be stored.

## 7. Interface Design

### 7.1 User Interface (if applicable)

Wireframes, mockups, and behavior description.

### 7.2 API Interfaces

List of APIs (endpoints, methods, parameters, responses).

## 8. Security Considerations
