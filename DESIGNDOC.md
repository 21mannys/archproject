## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document exists to record progress made on my project for Arch. It should be viewed by those looking for insight into why I made certain decisions or how I did certain things.

### 1.2 Scope

The project itself will be a linear regression model for stock market prediction, specifically Google's (GOOGL) stock prices, trained and evaluated based off of a data set containing Google stock prices from 2004 to today.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

API: Application Programming Surface <br/>
CSV: Comma Separated Values. A common file format for tabular data <br/>
Feature: An independent variable in a dataset used to predict an outcome <br/>
Kaggle: A data science platform for finding and sharing datasets, among other things.
Linear Regression: A statistical method for modeling relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation derived from data.
Line of best fit: A linear equation created using existing data, seeking to minimize the distance between the line and the data present.
Prediction: The output generated by the trained model for new, unseen data.

### 1.5 Overview

The rest of this document will explain the architechural design of my Google Sock Price Predictive Model. The __System Overview__ will outline the components that make up the system and how they interact with one another. __Design Considerations__ will go over assumptions, constraints, dependencies, goals and guidelines that influenced the design of the model. __Architecture Design__ will include helpful diagrams with descriptions to visualize every part of the system's processes. __Detailed Design__ will then  go into more detail when it comes to each component making up the larger system. Following that, the document will address __Data Design__, __Interface Design__, __Security Considerations__, __Performance Considerations__, __Testing and Validation__ will be covered for completeness. Following that will be __Appendices__ containing additional information.

## 2. System Overview

The system should consist of 6 different components.

#### 1. Data Import
The data will be imported from kaggle using their Kaggle API, then downloaded locally as a CSV file, and enabling the model to interact with the data. This will enable my system to be updated with the latest information.
#### 2. Data Pre-processing
This module will parse for missing data and categorize relevant features properly. This module could also refactor certain data to create new variables for newly relevant information, like how many days it's been since important events. This could be important because of how much stock value can be influenced by world news.
#### 3. Model Training
In this module the data will be used to train the model. 80% of it will be used in order to train the data, and the other 20% will be used to test the data later. Using the training portion, we'll create a line of best fit using a linear regression algorithm and the training data.
#### 4. Model Evaluation
After the model's been trained, we can check its accuracy using our testing portion from earlier. 
## 3. Design Considerations
